// syncRejectRule recomputes the reject set from the registry and writes it to the
// active config, reloading the process when the managed rule changed. The same
// recomputation then reaches dest, which enforces the lifecycle for naive on its
// own. Reload failure falls back to Restart (matching ApplyConfig). Status is
// read via getProcessStatus() (test-overridable) so a nil h.process never panics.
//
// It returns the two ways the decision can fail to take effect, because a
// lifecycle change the panel reports as done while the user still connects is
// the one outcome nobody can debug from the UI:
//
//   - deferred — the rule was NOT written or NOT reloaded, and the caller's
//     answer should say so: a pending config draft (SyncRejectRuleActive defers
//     to the coming Apply), a read-only config, a write that failed, or a reload
//     AND restart that both failed. Empty when the rule is live. Nothing is
//     reported when the wanted rule is already the one in the active config —
//     a deferral that changes nothing is not a deferral.
//   - err — dest's: a decision that did not reach dest leaves the user
//     connecting over naive after the panel said they were disabled, and the
//     PATCH handler is standing right there with an answer to put it in.
//
// Used by the PATCH/reset handlers, the startup one-shot, and the expiry ticker.
// NOT used inside ApplyConfig (which issues its own reload — see
// config_handlers.go).
